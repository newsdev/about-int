# How can a developer help The New York Times newsroom?

## Who We Are
We are a software development team embedded within The New York Times newsroom. We work on behind-the-scenes technology, collaborating with teams that handle data, graphics and unique design presentations. We build tools for reporters, editors and designers as well as special projects for our readers.  We run experiments as well as guide, train and support the use of these tools.

Our goal is to apply software engineering as a newsroom craft towards:
- Bringing our readers stories they can‚Äôt get anywhere else
- Helping the wider newsroom see and pursue stories we wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be able to 
- Making the seemingly impossible story possible
