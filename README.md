# How can a developer help The New York Times newsroom?

## Who We Are
We are a digital projects team embedded within The New York Times newsroom. We work on behind-the-scenes technology, collaborating with teams that handle data, graphics and unique design presentations. 

We build tools for reporters, editors and designers as well as special projects for our readers.  We run experiments as well as guide, train and support the use of these tools.
